Showtime Remote
===============
Use your Android phone as a remote for Showtime (https://showtimemediacenter.com/)

Status
------
The current version of the app consist of only one button, which can send all of the available actions to Showtime, see https://showtimemediacenter.com/projects/showtime/wiki/HTTP_API. It also includes a settings screen where it is possible to set the ip address (and port number).

The next step is to figure out the usage of each action (some are obvious, others are not) and after that design a useful layout for the most basic buttons.
